🚀 Hackathon Project – Agrolink

🏆 Participation
Participated in the Healthcare Hackathon, organized by DiceyTech. This event brought together developers, designers, and problem-solvers to build scalable solutions under time-constrained, collaborative conditions.



👨‍💻 My Role – Backend Developer

I was responsible for designing and implementing the backend architecture of the application using JavaScript. My work primarily focused on:

- Structuring RESTful APIs to handle core business logic and database interactions.
- Implementing secure user authentication and session management.
- Ensuring modular, maintainable backend code using best practices (e.g., MVC pattern).
- Integrating third-party services to enhance functionality (e.g., payment gateways, email APIs).
- Writing unit and integration tests to ensure stability.



⚙️ Tech Stack

- Node.js – Runtime environment for backend logic
- Express.js – Lightweight web application framework for routing and middleware
- PostgreSQL – (Adapt to your stack) Primary data storage
- OAuth – Authentication strategy
- Git & GitHub – Version control and collaboration

## 💡 What I Learned

This hackathon significantly deepened my understanding of:
- Building scalable API architectures under time constraints.
- Collaborating in distributed teams via Git workflows.
- Deploying backend services in a CI/CD pipeline.
- Handling real-world development pressure and iterative design.

## 📌 Reflection

The experience underscored the importance of cross-functional collaboration and rapid prototyping. It reinforced my confidence in backend systems engineering and honed my problem-solving mindset in a fast-paced environment. I look forward to leveraging these skills in more advanced Web3, FinTech, or system-level development contexts.
